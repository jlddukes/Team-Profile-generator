This repository is dedicated to the javascript concept of OOP - Object oriented programming

# Description
I have developed a command-line application using Node.js. The purpose of this application is to gather details about employees working in a software engineering team and generate an HTML webpage that provides summary information for each team member. As part of this assignment, my objective is to focus on writing unit tests and thoroughly testing the application's code to ensure it successfully passes all the tests.

# Usage
1. Open the integrated terminal.
2. Type 'npm install' to install the Inquirer package on your local device.
3. After the installation is complete, type 'node index.js' to load the prompt questions.
4. Finally, to run the tests, execute 'npm run' test.

# Packages Needed
1. NodeJS - https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Inquirer - https://www.npmjs.com/https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer
3. Jest - https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest (added Jest in package.json under script tests)
